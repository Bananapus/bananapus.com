<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  <span class="bananapus">bananapus</span> was
  <a href="https://www.jbdao.org/s/juicebox/368">funded by JuiceboxDAO</a> to
  develop and implement cross-chain Juicebox-based organizations, onchain
  governance based on staked positions, and new token distribution strategies.
  This website and the
  <a href="https://github.com/Bananapus/bananapus-721-staking-delegate"
    >smart contracts it interacts with</a
  >
  are the first realization of these objectives.
</p>
<p>
  Bananapus will deploy the Juicebox protocol on Ethereum layer 2 blockchains.
  Bananapus (and its projects) will be governed onchain. On the
  <a href="#/stake">Stake</a> page, anyone can stake $NANA to claim Bananapus
  governance NFTs. The more $NANA someone stakes, and the longer they stake it
  for, the more voting power they have over Bananapus.
</p>
<p>
  Bananapus will reserve a percentage its project's tokens for stakers. These
  tokens can be claimed over a vesting period. Bananapus members can begin their
  vesting periods and collect their rewards on the
  <a href="#/collect">Collect</a> page.
