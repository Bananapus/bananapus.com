<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  Bananapus was
  <a href="https://www.jbdao.org/s/juicebox/368">funded by JuiceboxDAO</a> to
  develop and implement solutions for cross-chain Juicebox-based organizations,
  onchain governance based on staked positions, and new token distribution
  strategies. This website and the
  <a href="https://github.com/Bananapus/bananapus-721-staking-delegate"
    >smart contracts it interacts with</a
  >
  are the first implementation of these objectives.
</p>
<p>
  Bananapus will be deploying the Juicebox protocol on Ethereum layer 2
  blockchains, and will deploy the first project on these versions of the
  protocol and collect fees. Bananapus (and its projects) will be governed
  onchain â€“ on the <a href="#/stake">Stake</a> page, JBX holders can stake their
  JBX to claim Bananapus governance NFTs. The more JBX someone stakes, and the
  longer they stake it for, the more voting power they have over Bananapus.
</p>
<p>
  Bananapus will reserve a percentage its project's tokens to be claimed by
  stakers over a vesting period. Bananapus members can begin their vesting
  periods and collect their rewards in the <a href="#/collect">Collect</a> page.
